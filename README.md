Simple rock, paper, scissors game, played in the console. Maybe add GUI later.

Update:

Added UI and it's now possible to play this game using inserted buttons. Once 5 rounds have been played, a winner is determined (player or computer). To start a new game simply click on Try Again. The text and text color changes depending on whether you have won, lost or tied.
